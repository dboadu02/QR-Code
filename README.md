### What I learned

One major thing i learnt was how to center a div
```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  border:double 5px transparent ;
}

.proud-of-this-css {
   display: flex;
    height: 100vh;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

I'm open to whatsoever challenge that comes my way since I'm looking forward to developing myslef in this field
